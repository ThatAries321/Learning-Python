## Purpose of Each File

### 1. **hello.py**
   - **Purpose:** This is your starting point with Python. It simply prints the message `"Hello, World!"` to the console.
   - **Concepts Covered:** Basic syntax, `print()` function.

### 2. **variables.py**
   - **Purpose:** Introduces different variable types in Python.
   - **Concepts Covered:** Strings, integers, floats, and booleans. Demonstrates how to assign values to variables and print them.
   
### 3. **operators.py**
   - **Purpose:** Introduces the basic arithmetic operators in Python.
   - **Concepts Covered:** Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulo, and exponentiation.

### 4. **conditions.py**
   - **Purpose:** Explains how to control the flow of your program based on conditions using `if`, `elif`, and `else`.
   - **Concepts Covered:** Conditional statements for making decisions based on variable values.

### 5. **loops.py**
   - **Purpose:** Shows how to perform repetitive tasks with loops.
   - **Concepts Covered:** 
     - `for` loop to iterate over a sequence (like numbers).
     - `while` loop to repeat an action as long as a condition holds true.
   
### 6. **functions.py**
   - **Purpose:** Introduces functions, which are reusable blocks of code.
   - **Concepts Covered:** 
     - Function definition with parameters.
     - Functions that return a value vs. those that do not.

### 7. **collections.py**
   - **Purpose:** Introduces common Python collections (data structures).
   - **Concepts Covered:**
     - Lists: Ordered, mutable collections of items.
     - Tuples: Ordered, immutable collections.
     - Dictionaries: Collections of key-value pairs.
     - Sets: Unordered collections of unique elements.
   
### 8. **error_handling.py**
   - **Purpose:** Teaches how to handle runtime errors and exceptions gracefully using `try-except`.
   - **Concepts Covered:** Exception handling, dealing with errors without crashing the program.
